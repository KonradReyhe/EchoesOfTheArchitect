# .cursorrules for Echoes of the Architect

# === GENERAL GUIDELINES ===
* Write clean, documented code that reflects the spiritual nature of the game
* Use consistent naming conventions across all files
* Add type hints and docstrings for all new methods
* Handle asset loading errors gracefully
* Log meaningful debug messages during development
* Test all soul state interactions thoroughly

# === PROJECT STRUCTURE ===
/assets
  /images
    /backgrounds    # 1280x720 scene backgrounds
    /cutouts       # PNG sprites with transparency
    /inventory     # 64x64 item icons
/engine
  scene_base.py    # Abstract base class for scenes
  inventory.py     # Item management system
  ui.py           # Message and ChoiceBox classes
  serpent_within.py # Inner state manifestation
/scenes
  garden.py       # Scene 1: First moral choice
  mirrors.py      # Scene 2: Soul reflection
  field.py        # Scene 3: Divine silence
  gate.py         # Scene 4: Judgment
  chamber.py      # Scene 5: Final state
  serpent.py      # Scene 6: Inner confrontation

# === SCENE IMPLEMENTATION RULES ===
1. Each scene must inherit from Scene base class
2. Required methods:
   - load_assets()
   - handle_event()
   - update(dt)
   - draw(screen)
3. Use consistent positioning:
   - Messages: (40, SCREEN_HEIGHT - 100)
   - Choice boxes: (40, SCREEN_HEIGHT - 150)
   - Inventory: Bottom right
4. Handle transitions properly using update_transition(dt)

# === SOUL STATE TRACKING ===
Track in game_state.py:
* light_score: int  # Increases with virtuous choices
* sin_score: int    # Increases with selfish choices
* memory_of_form: bool  # Set by prayer/meditation
* inner_serpent: str  # "pride"|"envy"|"apathy"|"purified"

# === INVENTORY GUIDELINES ===
* Item names: snake_case (e.g., golden_fruit)
* Image paths: assets/images/inventory/{item_name}.png
* Standard size: 64x64 pixels
* Max slots: 5 items

# === UI STANDARDS ===
Messages:
* Font: Georgia, 28pt
* Duration: 5.0 seconds
* Background: Semi-transparent black (alpha 160)
* Text color: Warm white (255, 240, 200)

Choice Boxes:
* Font: Georgia, 28pt
* Max options: 4 per box
* Background: Semi-transparent black (alpha 128)
* Selected color: (255, 255, 0)

# === ASSET NAMING ===
Backgrounds: background_{scene_name}.png
Cutouts: {object_name}.png
Inventory: {item_name}.png
Variations: {base_name}_{state}.png

# === DEBUG FEATURES ===
* Use __debug__ for development visuals
* Log asset loading and state changes
* Show clickable areas when debugging
* Print inventory changes to console

# === SPIRITUAL MECHANICS ===
* All choices must have meaningful consequences
* Track and react to player's moral state
* Use symbolic imagery consistently
* Maintain allegorical meaning in puzzles

# === CODE STYLE ===
* Use PEP 8 conventions
* Add docstrings to all classes and methods
* Include type hints for parameters
* Keep methods focused and single-purpose
* Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)

# === ERROR HANDLING ===
* Gracefully handle missing assets
* Provide fallback behaviors
* Log errors meaningfully
* Maintain game state consistency

# === TESTING GUIDELINES ===
* Test all scene transitions
* Verify soul state tracking
* Check inventory interactions
* Validate choice consequences
* Test asset loading paths

# === VERSION CONTROL ===
* Commit messages: Start with verb (Add, Fix, Update)
* Reference issue numbers when applicable
* Keep commits focused and atomic
* Document major changes

Remember: This is a spiritual journey, not just a game.
Every mechanic should serve the allegorical meaning.
